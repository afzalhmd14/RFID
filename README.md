RFID README
The Project is about creating an RFID Access System API for Raspberry Pi. 
The RFID Cards used at IITG are Mifare Classic Cards. The Reader used in the project is MFRC522 Reader. 
The API will provide the following functions : 
    1)Reading and Writing from the Card.
    2)Looking up for the Card in a SQL Database and pulling the entries with matching RFID.
    3)Modifying/Adding new entries to the database. 
    4)Saving Logs and other Information.

Currently Raghuram is the only one working on this.
